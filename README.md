This plugin was originally written for a laugh, but it can be
useful. If you use the web UI for multiple RabbitMQ servers
(e.g. different federation sites, or dev / test / prod) then it can be
helpful to make their UIs look different so it's always clear which
one you're using.

Build it like any other plugin, or check compiled/ for a prebuilt .ez
that will work with most recent RabbitMQ versions.

Currently there are a couple of extra themes that change the highlight
colour, and one dark theme that changes everything.

Usage:

 * Click on "Theme" in the top right corner
 * Don't take it too seriously
 * But feel free to contribute new themes
